1. Compute the total amount charged per credit card.

SELECT 
    c.CCNumber, 
    SUM(o.PriceSold) AS total_amount
FROM 
    credit_card c
JOIN 
    basket b ON c.StoredCardCID = b.CID
JOIN 
    appears_in o ON b.BID = o.BID
GROUP BY 
    c.CCNumber;

2. Compute the 10 best customers (in terms of money spent) in descending order.

SELECT 
    c.CID, 
    c.FName, 
    c.LName, 
    SUM(o.PriceSold) AS total_spent
FROM 
    customer c
JOIN 
    basket b ON c.CID = b.CID
JOIN 
    appears_in o ON b.BID = o.BID
GROUP BY 
    c.CID, c.FName, c.LName
ORDER BY 
    total_spent DESC
LIMIT 10;


3. For a given time period (begin date and end date) compute the most frequently sold products.

SELECT 
    a.PID, 
    p.PName, 
    COUNT(a.PID)
FROM 
    transaction t, basket b, appears_in a, product p
WHERE 
    t.BID = b.BID AND a.BID = b.BID AND p.PID = a.PID AND (t.Tdate BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2025-01-01')
GROUP BY 
    p.Pname, a.PID
ORDER BY 
    COUNT(a.PID) DESC;


4. For a given time period (begin date and end date) compute the products which are sold to the
highest number of distinct customers.

SELECT 
    a.PID, 
    p.PName, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT t.CID) AS NumberofCustomer
FROM 
    transaction t, basket b, appears_in a, product p
WHERE 
    t.BID = b.BID AND a.BID = b.BID AND p.PID = a.PID AND (t.Tdate BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2025-01-01')
GROUP BY 
    p.Pname, a.PID
ORDER BY 
    NumberofCustomer DESC;


5. For a given time period (begin date and end date) compute the maximum basket total amount
per credit card.

SELECT 
    subquery.CCNumber, 
    MAX(subquery.totalAmount) AS MaxBasketTotalAmount
FROM 
    (SELECT 
        t.CCNumber, 
        SUM(a.PriceSold * a.Quantity) AS totalAmount
    FROM 
        transaction t
    JOIN 
        basket b ON t.BID = b.BID
    JOIN 
        appears_in a ON a.BID = b.BID
    WHERE 
        t.TDate BETWEEN '2022-10-10' AND '2024-10-10'
    GROUP BY 
        t.CCNumber, b.BID) AS subquery
GROUP BY 
    subquery.CCNumber;



6. For a given time period (begin date and end date) compute the average selling product price
per product type (desktop, laptop, and printer).

SELECT 
    p.PType, 
    AVG(a.PriceSold)
FROM 
    transaction t, basket b, appears_in a, product p
WHERE 
    t.BID = b.BID AND a.BID = b.BID AND p.PID = a.PID AND (t.Tdate BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2025-01-01')
GROUP BY 
    p.PType;
